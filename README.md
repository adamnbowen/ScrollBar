ScrollBar
========
This class provides a simple, fully costumizeable interface for creating costum scrollbars, both horizontal and vertical.
The class also comes with some default styles that you can play with.

Tested on Firefox 3.6, Chrome 8 and IE7/8

How to use
----------
Usage is fairly simple:

    #JS
    var scroll = new CostumeScroll(wrapper,options);
    
There are quite a lot of tweaks you can do on the class, so for better understanding I suggest you read the docs.
